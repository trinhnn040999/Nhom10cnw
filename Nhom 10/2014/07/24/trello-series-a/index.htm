				<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/joel-spolskys-trello-is-a-simple-workflow-and-list-manager-for-groups/">Disrupt alum</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> has pulled in a $10.3 million funding round. The startup launched its visual project management system back in September 2011, on <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/joel-spolskys-trello-is-a-simple-workflow-and-list-manager-for-groups/">TC&#8217;s startup battlefield stage</a>.</p>
<p>Three years on and its freshly announced Series A funding round is being co-led by <a>Index Ventures</a> and <a>Spark Capital</a>. As part of the investment, Spark&#8217;s <a>Bijan Sabet</a> will be joining the Trello board.</p>
<p>The visual organizing software has amassed some 4.6 million registered users &#8212; now with one million monthly actives &#8212; turning their projects, whether household to-do lists or corporate realignment plans, into visual boards using its cloud-based software.</p>
<p><a title="Trello" target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trello">Trello</a> has a freemium model, monetizing its free at the point of use model with addition paid-for business-focused features. The boards are made up of a series of individual cards, that can include text and images, with users able to organize cards into lists, colour code them with labels, add due dates, track project progress and so on.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" href="We%20had a bunch of ideas for ways we could make Trello grow faster and do all kinds of astonishing new features and hire sales and marketing teams to work on Trello Business Class. We  would have gotten around to all that eventually, but not as quickly as we could with a bit of folding money.">blog</a> announcing today&#8217;s raise, co-founder <a>Joel Spolsky</a> explained the rational behind Trello&#8217;s makers, the <a>Fog Creek Software</a> team, taking big VC cash for Trello, given the company and product were already profitable.</p>
<p>He also details how they went about it: namely by spinning out Trello as a separate company, so that the investment could be focused on that product alone, and that company culture could be best preserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, we didn’t <em>need</em> the money, but we certainly <em>like</em> money,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;We had a bunch of ideas for ways we could make Trello grow faster and do all kinds of astonishing new features and hire sales and marketing teams to work on Trello Business Class. We would have gotten around to all that eventually, but not as quickly as we could with a bit of folding money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We spun out Trello into its own company, Trello Inc., and allowed outside investors to buy a minority stake in that. So now, Trello and Fog Creek are officially separate companies. Trello has a bunch of money in the bank to operate independently. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek</a> will continue to build <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">FogBugz</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/">Kiln</a> and continue to develop new products every once in a while. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/michaelpryor">Michael Pryor</a>, who co-founded Fog Creek with me in 2000, will be CEO of Trello,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Talking more generally about the challenge of retaining the spirit, culture and control of a startup after taking in big VC cash, Spolsky notes that Trello deliberately opted to avoid taking outside investment until it had enough traction and revenue to enable it to have the pick of investors &#8212; and choose those it thought were &#8220;the most entrepreneur-friendly&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the case of Trello, we had so much interest from investors that we were even able to limit ourselves to investors who were already investors in Stack Exchange [another Spolsky product] and still get the price and terms we wanted. The advantage of this is that we know them, they know us, and they’re aligned enough not to fret about any conflicts of interest which might arise between Stack Exchange and Trello because they have big stakes in both,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Fog Creek, Trello, and Stack Exchange are now three separate companies, they are all running basically the same operating system, based on the original microprocessor architecture known as “making a company where the best developers want to work,” or, in simpler terms, treating people well,&#8221; adds Spolsky.</p>
<p>The Spolsky startup philosophy of treating staff well extends to having La Marzocco Linea espresso machines in every office, height adjustable desks, remote working and family-friendly polices &#8212; including $500 food delivery vouchers for new parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s OK to put people first. You don’t have to be a psychopath or work people to death or create heaps of messy code or work in noisy open offices,&#8221; he adds.</p>

disappointing you and, ultimately, for letting you down,\u201d Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman wrote, <a href=\"https:\/\/quibi-hq.medium.com\/an-open-letter-from-quibi-8af6b415377f\">closing out an open letter<\/a> posted to Medium. \u201cWe cannot thank you enough for being there with us, and for us, every step of the way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With that, the founding executives confirmed the rumors and put <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/quibi\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"quibi\">Quibi <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> to bed, a little more than six months after launching the service.<\/p>\n<p>Starting a business is an impossibly difficult task under nearly any conditions, but even in a world that\u2019s littered with high-profile failures, the streaming service\u2019s swan song was remarkable for both its dramatically brief lifespan and the amount of money the company managed to raise (and spend) during that time.<\/p>\n<p>A month ahead of its commercial launch, Quibi announced that it had raised another $750 million. That second round of funding brought the <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yet-to-launch<\/span> streaming service\u2019s funding up to $1.75 billion \u2014 roughly the same as the gross domestic product of Belize, give or take $100 million.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe concluded a very successful second raise which will provide Quibi with a strong cash runway,\u201d CFO Ambereen Toubassy told the press at the time. \u201cThis round of $750 million gives us tremendous flexibility and the financial wherewithal to build content and technology that consumers embrace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tQuibi&#8217;s second funding round brought the yet-to-launch streaming service\u2019s funding up to $1.75 billion \u2014 roughly the same as the gross domestic product of Belize, give or take $100 million.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>From a financial perspective, Quibi had reason to be hopeful. Its fundraising ambitions were matched only by the aggressiveness with which it planned to spend that money. At the beginning of the year, Whitman touted the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/13\/quibi-execs-jeffrey-katzenberg-and-meg-whitman-explain-their-big-vision\/\">company\u2019s plans to spend up<\/a> to $100,000 per minute of programming \u2014 $6 million per hour. The executive proudly contrasted the jaw-dropping sum to the estimated $500 to $5,000 an hour spent by YouTube creators.<\/p>\n<p>For Whitman and Katzenberg \u2014 best known for their respective reigns at HP and Disney \u2014 money was key to success in an already crowded marketplace. Indeed, $1 billion was a drop in the bucket compared to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2020\/01\/23\/netflix-will-spend-173-billion-on-content-this-yea.aspx\">$17.3 billion<\/a> Netflix was expected to spend on original content in 2020, but it was a start.<\/p>\n<p>Following in the footsteps of Apple, who had also recently announced plans to<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/16\/apple-said-to-be-spending-1-billion-on-original-content-in-2018\/\"> spend $1 billion<\/a> to launch its own fledgling streaming service, the company was enlisting A-List talent, from Steven Spielberg, Guillermo del Toro and Ridley Scott to Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Lopez and LeBron James. If your name carried any sort of clout in Hollywood boardrooms, Quibi would happily cut you a check, seemingly regardless of content specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Quibi&#8217;s strategy primarily defined itself by its constraints. In hopes of attracting younger millennial and Gen Z viewers, the company\u2019s content would be not just mobile-first, but mobile-only. There would be no smart TV app, no Chromecast or AirPlay compatibility. Pricing, while low compared to the competition, was similarly off-putting. After a 90-day free trial, $4.99 got you an ad-supported subscription. And boy howdy, were there ads. Ads upon ads. Ads all the way down. Paying another $3 a month would make them go away.<\/p>\n<p>Technological constraints and Terms of Service fine print forbade screen shots \u2014 a fundamental understanding of how content goes viral in 2020 (though, to be fair, one shared with other competing streaming services). Amusingly, the inability to share content led to videos <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zachraffio\/status\/1250273191810875392\">like this one<\/a> of director Sam Raimi\u2019s perplexingly earnest &#8220;The Golden Arm.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It features a built-on laugh track from viewers as Emmy winner Rachel Brosnahan lies in a hospital bed after refusing to remove a golden prosthetic. It&#8217;s an allegory, surely, but not one intentionally played for laughs. Many of the videos that did ultimately make the rounds on social media were regarded as a curiosity &#8212; strange artifacts from a nascent streaming service that made little sense on paper.<\/p>\n<p>Most notable of all, however, were the \u201cquick bites\u201d that gave the service its confusingly pronounced name.

Meanwhile the privately held Chinese pharmaceutical company, Sinovac, is moving forward with phase three trials for its own vaccine in Brazil, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Another private Chinese company, CanSino Biologics developed a vaccine that was already being distributed to members of the Chinese military in late July,<\/p>\n<p>A collaboration in the U.K. between the University of Oxford and European pharmaceutical company <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/astrazeneca\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"astrazeneca\">AstraZeneca <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is also recruiting volunteers in Brazil, India, the United Kingdom, the US and South Africa. And, in Australia, the Murdoch Children&#8217;s Research Institute is trying to see whether a vaccine used to prevent tuberculosis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/03\/health\/coronavirus-bcg-vaccine.html\">could be used to vaccinate against the coronavirus<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Finally in Russia, the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology in partnership with the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund have claimed to have developed a vaccine that the country has registered as the first one on the market cleared for widespread use. Russia has not published any data from the clinical trials it claims to have conducted to prove the efficacy of the vaccine and the World Health Organization still considers the treatment to be in the first phase of development.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Therapies in phase three clinical trials<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If vaccines can prevent against infection, a slew of companies are also working on ways to limit the severity of the disease should someone become infected with Sars-Cov-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org\/#treatment_antibodies\">The Milken Institute<\/a> lists 41 different therapies that have made it through to phase three of their clinical trials (the last phase before approval for widespread delivery).<\/p>\n<p>These therapies come in one of five primary categories: antibody therapies, antivirals, cell-based therapies, RNA-based treatments, and repurposing existing treatments that may be in pharmaceutical purgatory.<\/p>\n<p>Antibody therapies use the body&#8217;s natural defense systems either taken from the blood of people who have recovered from an infection or manufactured in a lab to neutralize the spread of a virus or bacteria. Antivirals, by contrast, stop a virus from spreading by attacking the viruses&#8217; ability to replicate. Cell-based therapies are designed to boost the immune system&#8217;s ability to fight pathogens like viruses or bacteria. Meanwhile RNA-based treatments are another method to stop the virus from replicating by blocking the construction of viral proteins. Finally, several companies are mining their libraries of old drug compounds to see if any might be candidates for COVID-19 treatments.<\/p>\n<p>So far, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raps.org\/news-and-articles\/news-articles\/2020\/3\/covid-19-therapeutics-tracker\">only three therapeutics have been approved to treat COVID-19<\/a>. In the U.K. and Japan dexamethasone has received approvals, while favilavir is being used in China, Italy and Russia; and &#8212; famously thanks to its use by the President &#8212; remdesivir has been approved in the United States, Japan and Australia.<\/p>\n<p>The US <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/24\/fda-now-allows-treatment-of-life-threatening-covid-19-cases-using-blood-from-patients-who-have-recovered\/\">is also using convalescent plasma to treat hospitalized patients<\/a> under emergency use authorizations. And special cases, like the President&#8217;s, have had access to other experimental treatments like Regeneron&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-020-02965-3\">cell therapy under emergency use authorizations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QRCGfR2jbH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/24\/fda-now-allows-treatment-of-life-threatening-covid-19-cases-using-blood-from-patients-who-have-recovered\/\">FDA now allows treatment of life-threatening COVID-19 cases using blood from patients who have recovered<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;FDA now allows treatment of life-threatening COVID-19 cases using blood from patients who have recovered&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/24\/fda-now-allows-treatment-of-life-threatening-covid-19-cases-using-blood-from-patients-who-have-recovered\/embed\/#?secret=QRCGfR2jbH\" data-secret=\"QRCGfR2jbH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>And<a href=\"https:\/\/nvca.org\/8-vc-backed-startups-helping-treat-covid-19\/\"> there are several US-based startups developing potential COVID-19 therapies<\/a>\u00a0in each of these areas.<\/p>\n<p>Adaptive Biotechnologies, Cytovia Therapeutics, and SAB Biotherapeutics are all developing antibody treatments. Applied Therapeutics is using an understanding of existing compounds to develop treatments for specific conditions associated with COVID-19. Cellularity has a cell-therapy that could reduce a patient&#8217;s viral load by stimulating so-called natural killer cells to attack infected cells. Humanigen has developed a new drug that could reduce fatalities in high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. Meanwhile Partner Therapeutics is working on a drug that could improve lung function in COVID-19 patients &#8212; and potentially boost antibody production against the virus and restore damaged lung cells. Finally, Sarepta Therapeutics has been working with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases to find ways for its RNA-based treatment to stop the spread of coronaviruses by attacking the ability for the virus to replicate.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Beyond therapies, startups are finding other ways to play a role in helping the nation address the COVID-19 epidemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt this point the U.S. doesn\u2019t have the best public health system, but at the same time we have best-in-class private companies who can sometimes operate a lot more efficiently than governments can,\u201d Carbon Health chief executive <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/carbon-health-and-color-founders-see-power-in-bringing-healthcare-to-the-edge\/\">Eran Bali told the audience at TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt 2020 conference<\/a>. \u201cWe also just recently launched a program to help COVID-positive patients get back to health quickly, a rehabilitation program.

As many of you know, Human Capital is a weekly newsletter where I break down the latest in labor, as well as diversity and inclusion in tech. It&#8217;s officially available as a newsletter, so if you want this content when it comes in hot Fridays at 1 p.m. PT, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">subscribe here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the election is coming up, this edition focuses heavily on California ballot measure Proposition 22. The TL;DR is that gig companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash really want to keep classifying their drivers and delivery folks as independent contractors, so they put millions of dollars into this ballot measure. This week, we saw Prop 22-related complaints and lawsuits filed, and an appeals court judge decide Uber and Lyft must reclassify their drivers. We also heard directly from gig workers on both sides about why they do or do not want to be independent contractors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But we\u2019ll also look at SoftBank\u2019s first investment from its D&amp;I fund, Pinterest\u2019s addition of a new Black board member and more. Let\u2019s jump in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Labor Struggles<\/strong><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<p><b>Uber and Lyft must classify drivers as employees, court rules<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But. And this is a big but. Uber and Lyft will likely appeal this decision and it\u2019s also possible this decision won\u2019t matter depending on how Prop 22 goes. We\u2019re just a couple of weeks out from Election Day and this decision has a thirty day hold on it once the remittitur goes into effect. And that remittitur has not yet been issued.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the case, Uber and Lyft have argued that reclassifying their drivers as employees would cause irreparable harm to the companies. In the ruling today, the judge said neither company would suffer any &#8220;grave or irreparable harm by being prohibited from violating the law&#8221; and that their respective financial burdens &#8220;do not rise to the level of irreparable harm.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, there is nothing in the preliminary injunction, according to the judge, that would prevent Uber and Lyft from offering flexibility and independence to their drivers. Lastly, the judge said Uber and Lyft have had plenty of time to transition their drivers from independent contractors to employees, given that the key case in passing AB 5, the gig worker bill that spurred this lawsuit, was decided in 2018.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Amazon workers protest for time off to vote<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahead of Election Day, Amazon employees protested at the company\u2019s headquarters in Seattle for paid time off to vote. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2020\/amazon-employees-protest-seattle-hq-ask-paid-time-off-workers-can-vote\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement to GeekWire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Amazon said employees that don\u2019t have enough time off can request additional, excused time off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe number of hours and pay provided to employees varies by state in line with local laws,\u201d the spokesperson said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to GeekWire, Amazon notified managers that they should approve PTO requests for voting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/apple-twitter-salesforce-giving-workers-time-off-to-vote-2020-9#verizon-is-giving-its-us-workers-four-hours-of-paid-time-off-to-vote-on-election-day-6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech companies that are giving employees paid time off <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for Election Day include Salesforce, Apple (hourly employees get four hours), Facebook, Twitter, Uber and others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>No on Prop 22 camp files complaint with USPS against Yes on 22<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opponents of California\u2019s Proposition 22\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/21\/prop-22-opponents-say-yes-on-22-should-not-be-able-to-mail-flyers-as-nonprofit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed a complaint this week with the United States Postal Service<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The No on 22 campaign alleges the Yes side is not eligible for a nonprofit postal status and is asking USPS to revoke its permit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s much cheaper to send campaign mailers as a nonprofit organization. For example, sending between 1 \u2013 200,000 small mailers to every door normally costs $0.302 per piece. As a nonprofit, that costs $0.226 per piece, according to USPS. To be clear, the Yes on 22 campaign confirmed it was formed as a nonprofit organization under IRS section 501(c)(4), which pertains to social welfare organizations. But the No on 22 side says USPS erred in approving the Yes on 22 campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement to TC, Yes on 22 spokesperson Geoff Vetter said, \u201cAs a 501(c)(4) organization, Yes on 22 is eligible for the appropriate nonprofit postage rates with the USPS, which we applied for and were granted by the U.S. Postmaster.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Uber faces class-action lawsuit over Prop 22<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/22\/uber-drivers-sue-company-alleging-coercive-prop-22-advertising\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uber is facing a class-action lawsuit over Proposition 22<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that alleges the company is illegally coercing its drivers to support the ballot measure that seeks to keep workers classified as independent contractors.

We would have gotten around to all that eventually, but not as quickly as we could with a bit of folding money.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We spun out Trello into its own company, Trello Inc., and allowed outside investors to buy a minority stake in that. So now, Trello and Fog Creek are officially separate companies. Trello has a bunch of money in the bank to operate independently. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fogcreek.com\/\">Fog Creek<\/a>\u00a0will continue to build <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fogcreek.com\/FogBugz\/\">FogBugz<\/a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fogcreek.com\/kiln\/\">Kiln<\/a> and continue to develop new products every once in a while. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/michaelpryor\">Michael Pryor<\/a>, who co-founded Fog Creek with me in 2000, will be CEO of Trello,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Talking more generally about the challenge of retaining the spirit, culture\u00a0and control\u00a0of a startup after taking in big VC cash, Spolsky notes that Trello deliberately opted to avoid taking outside investment\u00a0until it had enough\u00a0traction and revenue\u00a0to enable it to have the pick of investors &#8212; and\u00a0choose those it thought were &#8220;the most entrepreneur-friendly&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the case of Trello, we had so much interest from investors that we were even able to limit ourselves to investors who were already investors in Stack Exchange [another Spolsky product] and still get the price and terms we wanted. The advantage of this is that we know them, they know us, and they\u2019re aligned enough not to fret about any conflicts of interest which might arise between Stack Exchange and Trello because they have big stakes in both,&#8221; he writes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Even though Fog Creek, Trello, and Stack Exchange are now three separate companies, they are all running basically the same operating system, based on the original microprocessor architecture known as \u201cmaking a company where the best developers want to work,\u201d or, in simpler terms, treating people well,&#8221; adds\u00a0Spolsky.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0Spolsky startup philosophy of treating staff well extends to having La Marzocco Linea espresso machines in every office, height adjustable desks, remote working and family-friendly polices &#8212; including $500 food delivery vouchers for new parents.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s OK to put people first. You don\u2019t have to be a psychopath or work people to death or create heaps of messy code or work in noisy open offices,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Disrupt alum Trello has pulled in a $10.3 million funding round.
