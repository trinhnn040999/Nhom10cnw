<meta property="og:description" content="Transcript for main presentation until Q&amp;A: My name is Brian Cervino, I’m the Community Manager at Trello and today’s topic is Getting Started With Trello. We’ll be covering a lot of material so if you ever want to go back and reference any of the points made in this webinar you can check out our getting started guide at trello.com/guide Before we get started I just want to let you know, everyone on the line is on mute. If you have any questions, concerns, or comments please type them into the GoToWebinar question box and I will be addressing them at the end of the webinar. Also I want to let you know that I will be recording today’s webinar and will email copies of it to all attendees. During this webinar I will cover Trello board basics, creating a new trello board, collaboration, essential Trello features and share some Trello tips &amp; tricks. I’d like to get started by showing you a Trello board that has already been created, which is a board I am using to plan a trip to Hawaii with my friends. As you can see this board is made up of lists and each list has cards added to them. Cards can represent tasks and you can click on cards to open them and get more detailed information about those tasks. Cards can be moved across lists as tasks progress from start to finish. Lists can also act as repositories of information. For instance, on this board there are lists for places to eat and sites to see. My friends and I can add cards to these lists and come up with a plan for our vacation. The goal of this webinar is to teach you how to create a Trello board with friends, family or colleagues to organize projects for both in and out of work. Create New Board To create a new board, click the plus sign in the top right corner of Trello and name your board after the project that you are organizing. Since I love throwing dinner parties I am going to name my board “Dinner Party” Add Lists A new Trello board is kind of like an empty canvas that can be customized to your workflow. I am going to start by adding some lists to my board. A To Do list, A Doing list, a Done list to manage my task workflow and a Menu list to organize the food and drinks. Lists can always be reorganized by dragging and dropping them into place and can be renamed if your workflow changes. Add Cards Next I am going to add cards to my lists for tasks that I need to do before my party. If you’ve already started making a list in another app you can simply copy that list and paste it into a new Trello card. Trello will give you the option to create a new card from each line separated item, which is a really handy timesaver. Cards can also be added by clicking “Add a card” and then typing out the card names. I am going to create some cards to plan my menu. Invite Members Now I am going to add some of my friends who volunteered to help out with this party to my board. This way I can assign them to tasks, and keep track of what tasks are done and what still needs to be taken care of. To add someone to your Trello board, click the ‘Add Members’ button and then either enter their name, email address, or username and select them from the list. If the person is not yet on Trello, you can invite them by submitting their email address. As soon as they sign up for Trello they will automatically be able to collaborate on your project. I also want to take a quick moment to mention board membership permissions. When you create a new Trello board, you are by default the admin for the board. This allows you to change the settings for the board, close the board, change the board’s background, etc. By default any new member you add to the board will have normal permissions, but you can give another board member admin permissions by clicking their avatar and changing them to admin. We like to recommend always having a second board admin or more, if you are comfortable, just in case the original admin drops off of the project and administrative decisions need to be made. Add To Cards &amp; @ Mention With my friends added to the board I am going to start delegating tasks. To do so I can drag and drop avatars from the sidebar onto a card, so I am going to add a few people to some cards. I can also open up a card, click the “Members” button and select their avatar. When someone is added to a card they will receive a notification within Trello and by email. If you are added to a card you will also receive notifications for updates to the card, such as if the card is moved to a different list or for an approaching due date on the card. Speaking of notifications, you can notify someone on a card by @ mentioning them in a comment. This is helpful for when you want to loop someone else into the progress of your card, to ask for feedback, or just to say something nice. Description, Checklist, Due Date Let me give you a more in depth tour of the card back and demonstrate some it’s features. To add more detailed information about a task, you can edit the card’s description. Right now I am just going to make a note to the present and future me. (pause) Since cleaning my house is going to require multiple steps, I am going to create a checklist to keep track of what’s been done and what still needs cleaning. Let me add a few items to my house cleaning checklist. (pause) As items get completed I can check them off. I will also assign a due date to this card and Trello will send me a notification 24-hours before this card is due as a reminder. Move Card, Attachments I know a lot of my friends have really busy lives so it is important that I finalize my guest list ASAP. I am going move the Finalize Guest List card over to Doing, and since I already started making a guest list in my notes app, I am going to attach it to the card. Trello lets you attach files from your computer or from popular cloud storage options. One neat trick though is that you can drag files onto a Trello card to upload and attach them. What’s also nice is that images attached to cards can be displayed as card covers to add more visual appeal to your board. Labels Labels can also be created and applied to cards and these are a great way to not only provide additional visual data to your cards, but they can act as tags for filtering cards on a board, which I will demonstrate in a moment. You can create and apply a label by opening a card and clicking the label button. Labels can also be named for easier reference. I am going to create a couple right now. One for household and one for shopping. I can click on a label to apply it to my card. Labels also have associated hotkeys, numbers 1-9 and 0, which I can use to quickly apply labels to cards. Sidebar, Filter Now I want to go a little deeper into some essential Trello features. Many of these features are located in the board’s sidebar, including general board and permissions settings. (Pause for settings) As I mentioned earlier, filtering cards on a board is a handy way to get a more granular perspective on cards. I can filter for my household labels to quickly see the status of those tasks. It is also possible to filter by cards assigned to board members, due dates, and card titles. Power-Ups, Calendar Power-ups are ways to add extra functionality and visualization to your board. Every Trello account comes with three power-ups - card aging, which gives cards an increasingly faded look as they go untouched, voting, which allows users to be able to upvote cards, and a calendar, which arranges all of your cards with due dates on them into a calendar view. Also, every board has a unique iCalendar feed which can be enabled and imported to any 3rd party calendar that accepts iCalendar feeds like Google Calendar, Apple’s Calendar, Sunrise &amp; many more. With Trello Business Class, you get a suite of 13 additional power-ups that allow you to integrate your favorite apps right into your Trello workflow, with many more to come. Backgrounds Boards can be personalized with board backgrounds. All accounts come with basic colors, and if you have Trello Gold or Business Class you get more background options as well as the ability to upload your own. Stickers Stickers are a fun way to add visual data to your boards or simply say good job. All accounts come with a basic sticker pack, and if you have Trello Gold or Business Class you get additional sticker packs and the ability to upload your own. Subscribing Boards, Cards, Lists One helpful way to stay on top of the progress on a board is by subscribing to boards, lists and cards. When you are added to or add yourself to a card you will automatically be subscribed to that card and get notifications for card movements, comments, etc as mentioned earlier. If you would like to get updates for all actions on a board then you can subscribe to the board. The same applies to lists and cards. I like to subscribe to the “Done” list on my boards so I can get a notification when a task is finished and then give that person a virtual hi-5. Copy Boards, Lists, Cards If you have workflows or tasks that you tend to repeat often then the ability to copy cards, lists, and boards might be appealing. One way we use the copy board feature at Trello is for our new employee onboarding board. Every new employee gets their own copy of this board, which has all of the resources they need to get up and running at Trello as well as to get know the rest team. Notifications Trello will send you notifications both in app, by email, and by push notification in our mobile apps if enabled. You can change your notification email preferences on your account settings page. When you receive a notification, the notification icon in the top right corner of Trello will turn red and if you are notified about a specific card a red notification badge will appear on that card. You will always receive notifications if you are mentioned in a comment, added to a card, board, or team, mentioned in a checklist item, if a board you are a member of is closed, and when someone makes you an admin of a board or team. If you are subscribed to a card you will also receive a notification for any comments on the card, adding, changing or upcoming due dates on the card, and if the card is moved or archived. When subscribed to a list or a board you’ll get the same notifications, but for all cards on that list or board. You’ll also get notifications for all newly created cards on that list or board. Shortcuts Now that I have gone over some of the more essential Trello features, let me just highlight a few tips and tricks that will help boost your productivity. Trello has a ton of keyboard shortcuts, which I am not going to go into now, but you can explore by hitting the question mark key on keyboard. Checklist Items Just like how you can create a set of Trello cards by copying and pasting a list into a new Trello card, the same applies for checklist items. I can quickly copy and paste my dinner menu into a checklist on my dinner card. Email To Board Each board also has a unique email address that can be used to create new Trello cards via email. Not only would this be great for keeping track of my RSVPs on my board when guests respond to my invite, but this could also be really helpful for sales teams looking for a way to track leads, or for HR teams to funnel candidate leads into a hiring process. My Cards If you ever want to view all of your assigned cards from all of your boards in one place then check out the Cards page which can be accessed from the Trello menu. You can sort your cards by board or due date. Also, Trello has apps available on iOS and Android, so you can organize and collaborate with your team from anywhere. Finally, I want to share some places where you can connect with us online.

<p>Transcript for main presentation until Q&amp;A:</p>

<p>My name is Brian Cervino, I’m the Community Manager at Trello and today’s topic is Getting Started With Trello. We’ll be covering a lot of material so if you ever want to go back and reference any of the points made in this webinar you can check out our getting started guide at trello.com/guide Before we get started I just want to let you know, everyone on the line is on mute. If you have any questions, concerns, or comments please type them into the GoToWebinar question box and I will be addressing them at the end of the webinar. Also I want to let you know that I will be recording today’s webinar and will email copies of it to all attendees.</p>

<p>During this webinar I will cover Trello board basics, creating a new trello board, collaboration, essential Trello features and share some Trello tips &amp; tricks.</p>

<p>I’d like to get started by showing you a Trello board that has already been created, which is a board I am using to plan a trip to Hawaii with my friends. As you can see this board is made up of lists and each list has cards added to them. Cards can represent tasks and you can click on cards to open them and get more detailed information about those tasks. Cards can be moved across lists as tasks progress from start to finish. Lists can also act as repositories of information. For instance, on this board there are lists for places to eat and sites to see. My friends and I can add cards to these lists and come up with a plan for our vacation.</p>

<p>The goal of this webinar is to teach you how to create a Trello board with friends, family or colleagues to organize projects for both in and out of work.</p>

<p>Create New Board</p>

<p>To create a new board, click the plus sign in the top right corner of Trello and name your board after the project that you are organizing. Since I love throwing dinner parties I am going to name my board “Dinner Party”</p>

<p>Add Lists</p>

<p>A new Trello board is kind of like an empty canvas that can be customized to your workflow. I am going to start by adding some lists to my board. A To Do list, A Doing list, a Done list to manage my task workflow and a Menu list to organize the food and drinks. Lists can always be reorganized by dragging and dropping them into place and can be renamed if your workflow changes.</p>

<p>Add Cards</p>

<p>Next I am going to add cards to my lists for tasks that I need to do before my party. If you’ve already started making a list in another app you can simply copy that list and paste it into a new Trello card. Trello will give you the option to create a new card from each line separated item, which is a really handy timesaver. Cards can also be added by clicking “Add a card” and then typing out the card names. I am going to create some cards to plan my menu.</p>

<p>Invite Members</p>

<p>Now I am going to add some of my friends who volunteered to help out with this party to my board. This way I can assign them to tasks, and keep track of what tasks are done and what still needs to be taken care of. To add someone to your Trello board, click the ‘Add Members’ button and then either enter their name, email address, or username and select them from the list. If the person is not yet on Trello, you can invite them by submitting their email address. As soon as they sign up for Trello they will automatically be able to collaborate on your project.</p>

<p>I also want to take a quick moment to mention board membership permissions. When you create a new Trello board, you are by default the admin for the board. This allows you to change the settings for the board, close the board, change the board’s background, etc. By default any new member you add to the board will have normal permissions, but you can give another board member admin permissions by clicking their avatar and changing them to admin. We like to recommend always having a second board admin or more, if you are comfortable, just in case the original admin drops off of the project and administrative decisions need to be made.</p>

<p>Add To Cards &amp; @ Mention</p>

<p>With my friends added to the board I am going to start delegating tasks. To do so I can drag and drop avatars from the sidebar onto a card, so I am going to add a few people to some cards. I can also open up a card, click the “Members” button and select their avatar. When someone is added to a card they will receive a notification within Trello and by email. If you are added to a card you will also receive notifications for updates to the card, such as if the card is moved to a different list or for an approaching due date on the card. Speaking of notifications, you can notify someone on a card by @ mentioning them in a comment. This is helpful for when you want to loop someone else into the progress of your card, to ask for feedback, or just to say something nice.</p>

<p>Description, Checklist, Due Date</p>

<p>Let me give you a more in depth tour of the card back and demonstrate some it’s features. To add more detailed information about a task, you can edit the card’s description. Right now I am just going to make a note to the present and future me. (pause) Since cleaning my house is going to require multiple steps, I am going to create a checklist to keep track of what’s been done and what still needs cleaning. Let me add a few items to my house cleaning checklist. (pause) As items get completed I can check them off. I will also assign a due date to this card and Trello will send me a notification 24-hours before this card is due as a reminder.</p>

<p>Move Card, Attachments</p>

<p>I know a lot of my friends have really busy lives so it is important that I finalize my guest list ASAP. I am going move the Finalize Guest List card over to Doing, and since I already started making a guest list in my notes app, I am going to attach it to the card. Trello lets you attach files from your computer or from popular cloud storage options. One neat trick though is that you can drag files onto a Trello card to upload and attach them. What’s also nice is that images attached to cards can be displayed as card covers to add more visual appeal to your board.</p>

<p>Labels</p>

<p>Labels can also be created and applied to cards and these are a great way to not only provide additional visual data to your cards, but they can act as tags for filtering cards on a board, which I will demonstrate in a moment. You can create and apply a label by opening a card and clicking the label button. Labels can also be named for easier reference. I am going to create a couple right now. One for household and one for shopping. I can click on a label to apply it to my card. Labels also have associated hotkeys, numbers 1-9 and 0, which I can use to quickly apply labels to cards.</p>

<p>Sidebar, Filter</p>

<p>Now I want to go a little deeper into some essential Trello features. Many of these features are located in the board’s sidebar, including general board and permissions settings. (Pause for settings) As I mentioned earlier, filtering cards on a board is a handy way to get a more granular perspective on cards. I can filter for my household labels to quickly see the status of those tasks. It is also possible to filter by cards assigned to board members, due dates, and card titles.</p>

<p>Power-Ups, Calendar</p>

<p>Power-ups are ways to add extra functionality and visualization to your board. Every Trello account comes with three power-ups - card aging, which gives cards an increasingly faded look as they go untouched, voting, which allows users to be able to upvote cards, and a calendar, which arranges all of your cards with due dates on them into a calendar view. Also, every board has a unique iCalendar feed which can be enabled and imported to any 3rd party calendar that accepts iCalendar feeds like Google Calendar, Apple’s Calendar, Sunrise &amp; many more. With Trello Business Class, you get a suite of 13 additional power-ups that allow you to integrate your favorite apps right into your Trello workflow, with many more to come.</p>

<p>Backgrounds</p>

<p>Boards can be personalized with board backgrounds. All accounts come with basic colors, and if you have Trello Gold or Business Class you get more background options as well as the ability to upload your own.</p>

<p>Stickers</p>

<p>Stickers are a fun way to add visual data to your boards or simply say good job. All accounts come with a basic sticker pack, and if you have Trello Gold or Business Class you get additional sticker packs and the ability to upload your own.</p>

<p>Subscribing Boards, Cards, Lists</p>

<p>One helpful way to stay on top of the progress on a board is by subscribing to boards, lists and cards. When you are added to or add yourself to a card you will automatically be subscribed to that card and get notifications for card movements, comments, etc as mentioned earlier. If you would like to get updates for all actions on a board then you can subscribe to the board. The same applies to lists and cards. I like to subscribe to the “Done” list on my boards so I can get a notification when a task is finished and then give that person a virtual hi-5.</p>

<p>Copy Boards, Lists, Cards</p>

<p>If you have workflows or tasks that you tend to repeat often then the ability to copy cards, lists, and boards might be appealing.</p>

<p>One way we use the copy board feature at Trello is for our new employee onboarding board. Every new employee gets their own copy of this board, which has all of the resources they need to get up and running at Trello as well as to get know the rest team.</p>

<p>Notifications</p>

<p>Trello will send you notifications both in app, by email, and by push notification in our mobile apps if enabled. You can change your notification email preferences on your account settings page.</p>

<p>When you receive a notification, the notification icon in the top right corner of Trello will turn red and if you are notified about a specific card a red notification badge will appear on that card. You will always receive notifications if you are mentioned in a comment, added to a card, board, or team, mentioned in a checklist item, if a board you are a member of is closed, and when someone makes you an admin of a board or team. If you are subscribed to a card you will also receive a notification for any comments on the card, adding, changing or upcoming due dates on the card, and if the card is moved or archived. When subscribed to a list or a board you’ll get the same notifications, but for all cards on that list or board. You’ll also get notifications for all newly created cards on that list or board.</p>

<p>Shortcuts</p>

<p>Now that I have gone over some of the more essential Trello features, let me just highlight a few tips and tricks that will help boost your productivity. Trello has a ton of keyboard shortcuts, which I am not going to go into now, but you can explore by hitting the question mark key on keyboard.</p>

<p>Checklist Items</p>

<p>Just like how you can create a set of Trello cards by copying and pasting a list into a new Trello card, the same applies for checklist items. I can quickly copy and paste my dinner menu into a checklist on my dinner card.</p>

<p>Email To Board</p>

<p>Each board also has a unique email address that can be used to create new Trello cards via email. Not only would this be great for keeping track of my RSVPs on my board when guests respond to my invite, but this could also be really helpful for sales teams looking for a way to track leads, or for HR teams to funnel candidate leads into a hiring process.</p>

<p>My Cards</p>

<p>If you ever want to view all of your assigned cards from all of your boards in one place then check out the Cards page which can be accessed from the Trello menu. You can sort your cards by board or due date.</p>

<p>Also, Trello has apps available on iOS and Android, so you can organize and collaborate with your team from anywhere.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to share some places where you can connect with us online. If you are ever looking for a little Trello board inspiration check out trello.com/inspiration where we have curated examples of different Trello workflows for both business and life from the community and from our very internal Trello boards. We also have a blog located at blog.trello.com which features updates, tips, and articles about productivity, tech, and more. Bring your favorite apps into your Trello workflow and customize your boards with our Integrations page. If you are using Trello within a company or team, I would recommend checking out Trello Business Class for additional Trello features, integrations, and administrative controls. Follow us Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and other social networks for updates, tips, and shared content from the Trello community.</p>

I can quickly copy and paste my dinner menu into a checklist on my dinner card.&#x000A;&#x000A;Email To Board&#x000A;&#x000A;Each board also has a unique email address that can be used to create new Trello cards via email. Not only would this be great for keeping track of my RSVPs on my board when guests respond to my invite, but this could also be really helpful for sales teams looking for a way to track leads, or for HR teams to funnel candidate leads into a hiring process.&#x000A;&#x000A;My Cards&#x000A;&#x000A;If you ever want to view all of your assigned cards from all of your boards in one place then check out the Cards page which can be accessed from the Trello menu. You can sort your cards by board or due date.&#x000A;&#x000A;Also, Trello has apps available on iOS and Android, so you can organize and collaborate with your team from anywhere.&#x000A;&#x000A;Finally, I want to share some places where you can connect with us online. If you are ever looking for a little Trello board inspiration check out trello.com/inspiration where we have curated examples of different Trello workflows for both business and life from the community and from our very internal Trello boards. We also have a blog located at blog.trello.com which features updates, tips, and articles about productivity, tech, and more. Bring your favorite apps into your Trello workflow and customize your boards with our Integrations page. If you are using Trello within a company or team, I would recommend checking out Trello Business Class for additional Trello features, integrations, and administrative controls. Follow us Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and other social networks for updates, tips, and shared content from the Trello community.&#x000A;&#x000A;If you have any questions about this webinar or about Trello in general please email support@trello.com.&#x000A;&#x000A; </textarea>
