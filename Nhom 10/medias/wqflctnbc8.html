<meta property="og:description" content="Transcript for main presentation until Q&amp;A: Hi, welcome to the HR Made Easy With Trello webinar. My name is Brian Cervino, I am the Community Manager at Trello and today I am joined by our support specialist Michelle Earhart. The goal of this webinar is to introduce six Trello boards that HR teams can utilize for each step of the process for hiring, onboarding, and maintaining a great company culture. During this webinar I will be going over the setup and workflows for the following boards: People Team Board Recruiting Pipeline Interview Pipeline New Employee Onboarding Employee Manual Social Committee After the presentation I will be glad to answer any questions about these boards, and how you can customize them to your team’s unique needs. If you have any questions please type them into the GoToWebinar question box and I will be addressing as many as possible during the time allotted, with help from Michelle. You can also email any questions to support@trello.com and our support team will be glad to answer any questions that you have. Also, I want to let you know that I will be recording today’s webinar and will email a copy of the recording to all attendees, and there is a handout available in the Handouts section of the GoToWebinar box that has links to all of the boards discussed as well as workflow summaries. Finally, I would like to give a really big shoutout to our VP of People at Trello, Liz Hall, who is the one that developed these boards that we use internally ourselves at Trello. Let’s get started. The People Team The first board I want to share is The People Team board which is a high level board that acts as a repository for all HR related boards, Slack channels, important HR related websites and essential readings. This board is really useful for not only the people team, but anyone at Trello that is looking to get some insight into our recruiting pipeline or looking to connect with the team. Also, anyone that gets added to our HR team can onboard with ease. The first list on this board has all of the essential team boards in one easy to access location, and we link to each board within each board’s respective card. I am going to go over each of these boards in detail during this webinar, but want to quickly demonstrate that when you copy and paste a link to a Trello board into a card description, comment, or checklist, it is automatically formatted into a nice link. The next list is a resource for non-board team assets such as a quick link to our jobs page and our recruiting team’s Slack channel. When interviews are happening, whoever is involved in the interview that day is often in the recruiting Slack channel communicating with our HR team and making sure everything is on schedule. Just a quick note, these links are formatted with Markdown, which allows you to add various formatting features to descriptions, comments and checklist items. For more information about Markdown formatting click the “Formatting help” link when a card’s description is in edit mode. The next list is for any upcoming HR conferences/recruiting events that the team is going to attend. Finally, we have a lot of lists for essential readings that all new HR hires are expected to read, as they help to illustrate and define our company culture and hiring policies, plus these lists also act as a handy repository of information for anyone on the team that is looking for a refresher. We add a little review/blurb about the article and a link in the card’s description. You can even encourage members of the team to leave their thoughts/feedback as comments on the card. If you are interested in all of these great resources on this board, a copy of the board is publicly available, and the link will be available in the handout provided with this webinar, so you can feel free to make use of the readings that our VP of People Liz Hall spent a good deal of time collecting. Recruiting Pipeline The recruiting pipeline board gives a quick visual overview of the status of various positions at the company, displaying projected future needs, what’s on hold, what needs to be posted, what is open, and what positions are closed. This quick overview is helpful for anyone at the company to see what our current and projected needs are, which makes it easier for them to help get involved in the recruiting process by being able to share open positions with friends, family, and professional connections, getting the HR team some good leads for projected openings. Job descriptions can be attached to card from either your local drive or through many cloud storage options. We attach job description documents via Google Drive. With the Google Drive Power-Up for Business Class enabled, it is easy to see when a document was created, when it was last edited, and by whom. It’s also easy to hop right into a Google doc to leave comments or feedback about the job description. Whichever recruiter is responsible for filling the position can be added to the card so that other team members will know who to reach out to with candidate leads or questions. Cards can be moved through the pipeline until the position is filled. It’s also possible that you might have multiple openings for a role, such as account managers. Easily copy cards so that you have an accurate account of exactly how many roles need to be filled. Another quick tip, if you want to quickly see all of the positions assigned to you, or anyone else on your team you can filter for just your cards from the sidebar of the board. Interview Pipeline Once a position is posted, and the applications start coming in, it’s time to start get the interview process underway. The Interview Pipeline board is for anyone on your recruiting team as well as anyone at the company that is involved in the interview process. This board allows you to layout the interview process for each position and manage applicants as they go through the interview pipeline. The first list on this board explains the interview process for each position. As you can see, each person that is involved with each step of the interview process is listed as well as what they might be covering in the interview. Because some of the information on these cards would expose a little too much about our interview process, I scrubbed some information, but as you can see for this more technical developer position there are code screens and more hands on projects involved. We also use a label for each open position and apply that label to every candidate that is interviewing for that position as well. This allows anyone to quickly surface anyone who is applying for any role. When an applicant becomes a potential candidate we start with a phone screen, so whoever is in charge of filling that role will create a new card on the Phone Screen list and add themselves to it. We use FogBugz internally to correspond with applicants and manage the communication process, so the FogBugz case associated with that applicant is added to the card. This way anyone involved with interviewing the candidate can easily jump into the case, leave notes and feedback from interviews, and the recruiter can reply to any email correspondence all in one location. An additional benefit of linking to an external ticketing or case management tool is that you can create an extra level of privacy and security by making sure that only the individuals that should have access to that recruiting information have access to those cases and applicants data. If someone passes the phone screen then their card is moved over to the interview list. Everyone that is going to be involved with the interview gets added to the card, which sends them a notification so that they are made aware of the interview. We also add a due date to the card, and this will send a reminder out to everyone on the card 24-hours before the card is due. We don’t want anyone to miss an interview with a candidate! This is also a great time to mention the Calendar Power-Up, which can be enabled on your boards giving you an overview of any cards with due dates in a calendar view. Each calendar also has a unique iCal feed that can be imported to any third party calendar. As you can see cards progress down the pipeline, and any comments or documents can be attached to a card so that all of the information regarding the candidate is stored and accessible from one location. For instance, drafts of offer letters can be attached to a card and collaborated on in Google Drive. Onboarding: Once an offer has been accepted, it’s time to bring your new hire on to your team. The next board I want to share is what we call the Onboarding board, which is a great way to make the first day for any new hire as smooth as possible. By creating a copiable template board that can be personalized for each new hire, you can provide a way to keep track of any first day or first week formalities, share any forms or documentation such as tax forms, and give them a quick and handy company reference manual. What I am going to do now is copy this board for our new hire Amy. The option to copy a board is in the board’ sidebar, just click “More” then “Copy Board” Break down the onboarding process into its individual steps and create a card for each step. Add relevant team members to any cards where they are supposed to help to make sure that the task is completed. For instance, add someone from HR to a card with tax forms attached so they can make sure all the proper forms get signed. Some tasks can be accomplished before your new hire even starts, and you can create lists to break up the tasks accordingly. In our case, we have a list for before someone starts and then a list for first day/first week tasks. Your new hire can move each card to the Done list as they complete those tasks. This way they can see what still needs to get done, and make sure nothing important falls through the cracks, like setting up that health insurance. Other lists on the board help answer some common questions that a new hire might have, such as what kind of equipment you can request to help you get your work done, or any additional awesome little perks that might make your day to day work that much better. Another list is who to contact with any specific questions about any topic, then a bit of information about company culture, and perhaps most conveniently, a Who’s Who list of fellow employees. This includes a little blurb from each person as well as their name and a picture. I’m sure we’ve all been led through an office our first day and been introduced to 50 new faces all at once. Now new hires can discreetly go back and put Becky or Bradley’s name to their face. Finally, We also make sure to collect feedback from new hires about the onboarding process and how the board helped them or could be improved. We use this information to reprioritize cards by dragging and dropping them to change their position, or make changes that will improve the onboarding process for future hires. Employee Manual Creating an employee manual on a Trello board is a simple, visual, easy to update, easy to search and accessible anywhere resource. This is valuable for not only new hires, but for anyone that works at your company, because it is a repository of all important company policies, forms and documents. Lists can be broken down into whatever makes sense for your company such as benefits, policies, and perks, and cards can be easily rearranged to draw attention to more important topics. Let me go over how we have ours set up. We have a list with a single card on it for every employee’s first day. This card links to all of the most important cards on the board so that they are not missed, as well as any other important information that we want to reinforce on day one that may have already been covered on onboarding board, but we want to make sure gets covered. A quick note, as you can see we link directly to other Trello cards here. It is easy to link to another Trello card by simply copying and pasting the link to that card in another card’s description. You can also use a hashtag and start typing a card’s name to search for and link to a card. Our Employee Manual has a list for all of the company’s benefits, and each topic has it’s own card. On each card we use the description to link to any related websites, and can attach any forms such as health insurance forms to the card as well. The next list covers everything one might have to ask about vacation policy, sick leave, etc. This actually came in handy for me recently when I was on jury duty and had to fill out some forms. One of the questions was about getting paid by your company during jury duty and I was able to access this board from my phone and quickly get the necessary information. Much better than having some printout filed away in the depths of my filing cabinet. The next lists cover items like conference budgets and travel guidelines, since everyone at the company is allowed to attend relevant conferences, and there is often the need to travel for work related matters. Since our company is half located in our NY headquarters and half remote, we have separate lists explaining the various perks that both headquarters and remote employees can enjoy, and answer common questions about either. Finally we have a catch-all list for any important topics that need to be addressed. Social Committee The last board I want to share is a newer board for us, but something that we are really excited about because we truly believe in building an awesome company culture at Trello. It is the Social Committee board, which allows the team to organize fun events for both remote and headquarter employees. Anyone is allowed to create an event, so this board starts out with a list explaining what the goals of the board are and the process for creating a team event. Creating an “About” list or “How To Use This Board” list is a great way to give an overview of a board’s workflow and intent for any first time viewers, and always makes a handy reference for anyone that needs a refresher on a policy or process. The next lists are pretty self explanatory, such as what’s being planned, what’s coming up and what fun has been had. If someone is planning an event they should add themselves to that card and add any related boards, Slack channels, or details about the event. If someone wants to join an event, they can add themselves to the card so that the event organizer has a headcount of who is attending. A couple quick tips, first, make sure that your board is team visible so that anyone on your team can join the board and then add themselves to cards Also, you can share invite links to boards and drop them into an email or chat room to spread the word throughout the company. Finally, we love sharing the fun we’ve had as a team and we encourage everyone to attach pictures to cards, either by clicking the attachment button and selecting the file from your computer or cloud storage solution, or by simply dragging and dropping a file right onto a card. Our HR team likes to share these pictures on our Trello Instagram account because it works as a great platform for potential applicants and candidates to learn more about our company culture. So that wraps up my presentation of how Trello can help make HR easier for your team. I am going to get the Q&amp;A session going in just a moment, focussing on questions about these boards first. Please enter any questions you have in the GoToWebinar box and I will make sure to address as many as possible in the time remaining. If you have to leave the webinar now and have questions or if you would rather ask your questions in private, feel free to email us at support@trello.com and we will be glad to answer them for you.

The next lists cover items like conference budgets and travel guidelines, since everyone at the company is allowed to attend relevant conferences, and there is often the need to travel for work related matters. Since our company is half located in our NY headquarters and half remote, we have separate lists explaining the various perks that both headquarters and remote employees can enjoy, and answer common questions about either. Finally we have a catch-all list for any important topics that need to be addressed. Social Committee The last board I want to share is a newer board for us, but something that we are really excited about because we truly believe in building an awesome company culture at Trello. It is the Social Committee board, which allows the team to organize fun events for both remote and headquarter employees. Anyone is allowed to create an event, so this board starts out with a list explaining what the goals of the board are and the process for creating a team event. Creating an “About” list or “How To Use This Board” list is a great way to give an overview of a board’s workflow and intent for any first time viewers, and always makes a handy reference for anyone that needs a refresher on a policy or process. The next lists are pretty self explanatory, such as what’s being planned, what’s coming up and what fun has been had. If someone is planning an event they should add themselves to that card and add any related boards, Slack channels, or details about the event. If someone wants to join an event, they can add themselves to the card so that the event organizer has a headcount of who is attending. A couple quick tips, first, make sure that your board is team visible so that anyone on your team can join the board and then add themselves to cards Also, you can share invite links to boards and drop them into an email or chat room to spread the word throughout the company. Finally, we love sharing the fun we’ve had as a team and we encourage everyone to attach pictures to cards, either by clicking the attachment button and selecting the file from your computer or cloud storage solution, or by simply dragging and dropping a file right onto a card. Our HR team likes to share these pictures on our Trello Instagram account because it works as a great platform for potential applicants and candidates to learn more about our company culture. So that wraps up my presentation of how Trello can help make HR easier for your team. I am going to get the Q&amp;A session going in just a moment, focussing on questions about these boards first. Please enter any questions you have in the GoToWebinar box and I will make sure to address as many as possible in the time remaining. If you have to leave the webinar now and have questions or if you would rather ask your questions in private, feel free to email us at support@trello.com and we will be glad to answer them for you.

<p>Transcript for main presentation until Q&amp;A:</p>

<p>Hi, welcome to the HR Made Easy With Trello webinar. My name is Brian Cervino, I am the Community Manager at Trello and today I am joined by our support specialist Michelle Earhart. The goal of this webinar is to introduce six Trello boards that HR teams can utilize for each step of the process for hiring, onboarding, and maintaining a great company culture.  During this webinar I will be going over the setup and workflows for the following boards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People Team Board</li>
  <li>Recruiting Pipeline</li>
  <li>Interview Pipeline</li>
  <li>New Employee Onboarding</li>
  <li>Employee Manual</li>
  <li>Social Committee</li>
</ul>

<p>After the presentation I will be glad to answer any questions about these boards, and how you can customize them to your team’s unique needs. If you have any questions please type them into the GoToWebinar question box and I will be addressing as many as possible during the time allotted, with help from Michelle. You can also email any questions to support@trello.com and our support team will be glad to answer any questions that you have. Also, I want to let you know that I will be recording today’s webinar and will email a copy of the recording to all attendees, and there is a handout available in the Handouts section of the GoToWebinar box that has links to all of the boards discussed as well as workflow summaries. Finally, I would like to give a really big shoutout to our VP of People at Trello, Liz Hall, who is the one that developed these boards that we use internally ourselves at Trello. Let’s get started.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The People Team</li>
</ul>

<p>The first board I want to share is The People Team board which is a high level board that acts as a repository for all HR related boards, Slack channels, important HR related websites and essential readings. This board is really useful for not only the people team, but anyone at Trello that is looking to get some insight into our recruiting pipeline or looking to connect with the team. Also, anyone that gets added to our HR team can onboard with ease.</p>

<p>The first list on this board has all of the essential team boards in one easy to access location, and we link to each board within each board’s respective card.</p>

<p>I am going to go over each of these boards in detail during this webinar, but want to quickly demonstrate that when you copy and paste a link to a Trello board into a card description, comment, or checklist, it is automatically formatted into a nice link.</p>

<p>The next list is a resource for non-board team assets such as a quick link to our jobs page and our recruiting team’s Slack channel. When interviews are happening, whoever is involved in the interview that day is often in the recruiting Slack channel communicating with our HR team and making sure everything is on schedule.</p>

<p>Just a quick note, these links are formatted with Markdown, which allows you to add various formatting features to descriptions, comments and checklist items. For more information about Markdown formatting click the “Formatting help” link when a card’s description is in edit mode.</p>

<p>The next list is for any upcoming HR conferences/recruiting events that the team is going to attend.</p>

<p>Finally, we have a lot of lists for essential readings that all new HR hires are expected to read, as they help to illustrate and define our company culture and hiring policies, plus these lists also act as a handy repository of information for anyone on the team that is looking for a refresher.  We add a little review/blurb about the article and a link in the card’s description. You can even encourage members of the team to leave their thoughts/feedback as comments on the card.</p>

<p>If you are interested in all of these great resources on this board, a copy of the board is publicly available, and the link will be available in the handout provided with this webinar, so you can feel free to make use of the readings that our VP of People Liz Hall spent a good deal of time collecting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recruiting Pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>The recruiting pipeline board gives a quick visual overview of the status of various positions at the company, displaying projected future needs, what’s on hold, what needs to be posted, what is open, and what positions are closed.  This quick overview is helpful for anyone at the company to see what our current and projected needs are, which makes it easier for them to help get involved in the recruiting process by being able to share open positions with friends, family, and professional connections, getting the HR team some good leads for projected openings.</p>

<p>Job descriptions can be attached to card from either your local drive or through many cloud storage options. We attach job description documents via Google Drive. With the Google Drive Power-Up for Business Class enabled, it is easy to see when a document was created, when it was last edited, and by whom. It’s also easy to hop right into a Google doc to leave comments or feedback about the job description. Whichever recruiter is responsible for filling the position can be added to the card so that other team members will know who to reach out to with candidate leads or questions.</p>

<p>Cards can be moved through the pipeline until the position is filled. It’s also possible that you might have multiple openings for a role, such as account managers. Easily copy cards so that you have an accurate account of exactly how many roles need to be filled.</p>

<p>Another quick tip, if you want to quickly see all of the positions assigned to you, or anyone else on your team you can filter for just your cards from the sidebar of the board.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interview Pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a position is posted, and the applications start coming in, it’s time to start get the interview process underway.  The Interview Pipeline board is for anyone on your recruiting team as well as anyone at the company that is involved in the interview process. This board allows you to layout the interview process for each position and manage applicants as they go through the interview pipeline.</p>

<p>The first list on this board explains the interview process for each position.</p>

<p>As you can see, each person that is involved with each step of the interview process is listed as well as what they might be covering in the interview. Because some of the information on these cards would expose a little too much about our interview process, I scrubbed some information, but as you can see for this more technical developer position there are code screens and more hands on projects involved.</p>

<p>We also use a label for each open position and apply that label to every candidate that is interviewing for that position as well. This allows anyone to quickly surface anyone who is applying for any role.</p>

<p>When an applicant becomes a potential candidate we start with a phone screen, so whoever is in charge of filling that role will create a new card on the Phone Screen list and add themselves to it.</p>

<p>We use FogBugz internally to correspond with applicants and manage the communication process, so the FogBugz case associated with that applicant is added to the card.</p>

<p>This way anyone involved with interviewing the candidate can easily jump into the case, leave notes and feedback from interviews, and the recruiter can reply to any email correspondence all in one location. An additional benefit of linking to an external ticketing or case management tool is that you can create an extra level of privacy and security by making sure that only the individuals that should have access to that recruiting information have access to those cases and applicants data.</p>

<p>If someone passes the phone screen then their card is moved over to the interview list.</p>

<p>Everyone that is going to be involved with the interview gets added to the card, which sends them a notification so that they are made aware of the interview. We also add a due date to the card, and this will send a reminder out to everyone on the card 24-hours before the card is due. We don’t want anyone to miss an interview with a candidate!</p>

<p>This is also a great time to mention the Calendar Power-Up, which can be enabled on your boards giving you an overview of any cards with due dates in a calendar view. Each calendar also has a unique iCal feed that can be imported to any third party calendar.</p>

<p>As you can see cards progress down the pipeline, and any comments or documents can be attached to a card so that all of the information regarding the candidate is stored and accessible from one location.</p>

<p>For instance, drafts of offer letters can be attached to a card and collaborated on in Google Drive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Onboarding:</li>
</ul>

<p>Once an offer has been accepted, it’s time to bring your new hire on to your team. The next board I want to share is what we call the Onboarding board, which is a great way to make the first day for any new hire as smooth as possible.  By creating a copiable template board that can be personalized for each new hire, you can provide a way to keep track of any first day or first week formalities, share any forms or documentation such as tax forms, and give them a quick and handy company reference manual.
What I am going to do now is copy this board for our new hire Amy. The option to copy a board is in the board’ sidebar, just click “More” then “Copy Board”</p>

<p>Break down the onboarding process into its individual steps and create a card for each step. Add relevant team members to any cards where they are supposed to help to make sure that the task is completed. For instance, add someone from HR to a card with tax forms attached so they can make sure all the proper forms get signed.</p>

<p>Some tasks can be accomplished before your new hire even starts, and you can create lists to break up the tasks accordingly. In our case, we have a list for before someone starts and then a list for first day/first week tasks. Your new hire can move each card to the Done list as they complete those tasks. This way they can see what still needs to get done, and make sure nothing important falls through the cracks, like setting up that health insurance.</p>

<p>Other lists on the board help answer some common questions that a new hire might have, such as what kind of equipment you can request to help you get your work done, or any additional awesome little perks that might make your day to day work that much better.</p>

<p>Another list is  who to contact with any specific questions about any topic, then a bit of information about company culture, and perhaps most conveniently, a Who’s Who list of fellow employees.</p>

<p>This includes a little blurb from each person as well as their name and a picture. I’m sure we’ve all been led through an office our first day and been introduced to 50 new faces all at once. Now new hires can discreetly go back and put Becky or Bradley’s name to their face.</p>

<p>Finally, We also make sure to collect feedback from new hires about the onboarding process and how the board helped them or could be improved. We use this information to reprioritize cards by dragging and dropping them to change their position, or make changes that will improve the onboarding process for future hires.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employee Manual</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating an employee manual on a Trello board is a simple, visual, easy to update, easy to search and accessible anywhere resource. This is valuable for not only new hires, but for anyone that works at your company, because it is a repository of all important company policies, forms and documents. Lists can be broken down into whatever makes sense for your company  such as benefits, policies, and perks, and cards can be easily rearranged to draw attention to more important topics. Let me go over how we have ours set up.</p>

<p>We have a list with a single card on it for every employee’s first day.</p>

<p>This card links to all of the most important cards on the board so that they are not missed, as well as any other important information that we want to reinforce on day one that may have already been covered on onboarding board, but we want to make sure gets covered.  A quick note, as you can see we link directly to other Trello cards here. It is easy to link to another Trello card by simply copying and pasting the link to that card in another card’s description. You can also use a hashtag and start typing a card’s name to search for and link to a card.</p>

<p>Our Employee Manual has a list for all of the company’s benefits, and each topic has it’s own card.</p>

<p>On each card we use the description to link to any related websites, and can attach any forms such as health insurance forms to the card as well.</p>

<p>The next list covers everything one might have to ask about vacation policy, sick leave, etc. This actually came in handy for me recently when I was on jury duty and had to fill out some forms. One of the questions was about getting paid by your company during jury duty and I was able to access this board from my phone and quickly get the necessary information. Much better than having some printout filed away in the depths of my filing cabinet.</p>

<p>The next lists cover items like conference budgets and travel guidelines, since everyone at the company is allowed to attend relevant conferences, and there is often the need to travel for work related matters.</p>

<p>Since our company is half located in our NY headquarters and half remote, we have separate lists explaining the various perks that both headquarters and remote employees can enjoy, and answer common questions about either.</p>

<p>Finally we have a catch-all list for any important topics that need to be addressed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Social Committee</li>
</ul>

<p>The last board I want to share is a newer board for us, but something that we are really excited about because we truly believe in building an awesome company culture at Trello. It is the Social Committee board, which allows the team to organize fun events for both remote and headquarter employees. Anyone is allowed to create an event, so this board starts out with a list explaining what the goals of the board are and the process for creating a team event.</p>

<p>Creating an “About” list or “How To Use This Board” list is a great way to give an overview of a board’s workflow and intent for any first time viewers, and always makes a handy reference for anyone that needs a refresher on a policy or process.</p>

<p>The next lists are pretty self explanatory, such as what’s being planned, what’s coming up and what fun has been had. If someone is planning an event they should add themselves to that card and add any related boards, Slack channels, or details about the event.</p>

<p>If someone wants to join an event, they can add themselves to the card so that the event organizer has a headcount of who is attending. A couple quick tips, first, make sure that your board is team visible so that anyone on your team can join the board and then add themselves to cards</p>

<p>Also, you can share invite links to boards and drop them into an email or chat room to spread the word throughout the company.</p>

<p>Finally, we love sharing the fun we’ve had as a team and we encourage everyone to attach pictures to cards, either by clicking the attachment button and selecting the file from your computer or cloud storage solution, or by simply dragging and dropping a file right onto a card.</p>

<p>Our HR team likes to share these pictures on our Trello Instagram account because it works as a great platform for potential applicants and candidates to learn more about our company culture.</p>

<p>So that wraps up my presentation of how Trello can help make HR easier for your team.  I am going to get the Q&amp;A session going in just a moment, focussing on questions about these boards first. Please enter any questions you have in the GoToWebinar box and I will make sure to address as many as possible in the time remaining.  If you have to leave the webinar now and have questions or if you would rather ask your questions in private, feel free to email us at support@trello.com and we will be glad to answer them for you.</p>

You can even encourage members of the team to leave their thoughts/feedback as comments on the card.&#x000A;&#x000A;If you are interested in all of these great resources on this board, a copy of the board is publicly available, and the link will be available in the handout provided with this webinar, so you can feel free to make use of the readings that our VP of People Liz Hall spent a good deal of time collecting. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;- Recruiting Pipeline&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;The recruiting pipeline board gives a quick visual overview of the status of various positions at the company, displaying projected future needs, what’s on hold, what needs to be posted, what is open, and what positions are closed.  This quick overview is helpful for anyone at the company to see what our current and projected needs are, which makes it easier for them to help get involved in the recruiting process by being able to share open positions with friends, family, and professional connections, getting the HR team some good leads for projected openings.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Job descriptions can be attached to card from either your local drive or through many cloud storage options. We attach job description documents via Google Drive. With the Google Drive Power-Up for Business Class enabled, it is easy to see when a document was created, when it was last edited, and by whom. It’s also easy to hop right into a Google doc to leave comments or feedback about the job description. Whichever recruiter is responsible for filling the position can be added to the card so that other team members will know who to reach out to with candidate leads or questions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Cards can be moved through the pipeline until the position is filled. It’s also possible that you might have multiple openings for a role, such as account managers. Easily copy cards so that you have an accurate account of exactly how many roles need to be filled.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Another quick tip, if you want to quickly see all of the positions assigned to you, or anyone else on your team you can filter for just your cards from the sidebar of the board.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;- Interview Pipeline&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Once a position is posted, and the applications start coming in, it’s time to start get the interview process underway.  The Interview Pipeline board is for anyone on your recruiting team as well as anyone at the company that is involved in the interview process. This board allows you to layout the interview process for each position and manage applicants as they go through the interview pipeline.&#x000A;&#x000A;The first list on this board explains the interview process for each position.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;As you can see, each person that is involved with each step of the interview process is listed as well as what they might be covering in the interview. Because some of the information on these cards would expose a little too much about our interview process, I scrubbed some information, but as you can see for this more technical developer position there are code screens and more hands on projects involved. &#x000A;&#x000A;We also use a label for each open position and apply that label to every candidate that is interviewing for that position as well. This allows anyone to quickly surface anyone who is applying for any role.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;When an applicant becomes a potential candidate we start with a phone screen, so whoever is in charge of filling that role will create a new card on the Phone Screen list and add themselves to it. &#x000A;&#x000A;We use FogBugz internally to correspond with applicants and manage the communication process, so the FogBugz case associated with that applicant is added to the card. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;This way anyone involved with interviewing the candidate can easily jump into the case, leave notes and feedback from interviews, and the recruiter can reply to any email correspondence all in one location. An additional benefit of linking to an external ticketing or case management tool is that you can create an extra level of privacy and security by making sure that only the individuals that should have access to that recruiting information have access to those cases and applicants data.&#x000A;&#x000A;If someone passes the phone screen then their card is moved over to the interview list.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Everyone that is going to be involved with the interview gets added to the card, which sends them a notification so that they are made aware of the interview. We also add a due date to the card, and this will send a reminder out to everyone on the card 24-hours before the card is due. We don’t want anyone to miss an interview with a candidate!&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;This is also a great time to mention the Calendar Power-Up, which can be enabled on your boards giving you an overview of any cards with due dates in a calendar view. Each calendar also has a unique iCal feed that can be imported to any third party calendar. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;As you can see cards progress down the pipeline, and any comments or documents can be attached to a card so that all of the information regarding the candidate is stored and accessible from one location. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;For instance, drafts of offer letters can be attached to a card and collaborated on in Google Drive.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;- Onboarding: &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Once an offer has been accepted, it’s time to bring your new hire on to your team. The next board I want to share is what we call the Onboarding board, which is a great way to make the first day for any new hire as smooth as possible.  By creating a copiable template board that can be personalized for each new hire, you can provide a way to keep track of any first day or first week formalities, share any forms or documentation such as tax forms, and give them a quick and handy company reference manual.&#x000A;What I am going to do now is copy this board for our new hire Amy. The option to copy a board is in the board’ sidebar, just click “More” then “Copy Board”&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Break down the onboarding process into its individual steps and create a card for each step. Add relevant team members to any cards where they are supposed to help to make sure that the task is completed. For instance, add someone from HR to a card with tax forms attached so they can make sure all the proper forms get signed. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Some tasks can be accomplished before your new hire even starts, and you can create lists to break up the tasks accordingly. In our case, we have a list for before someone starts and then a list for first day/first week tasks. Your new hire can move each card to the Done list as they complete those tasks. This way they can see what still needs to get done, and make sure nothing important falls through the cracks, like setting up that health insurance. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Other lists on the board help answer some common questions that a new hire might have, such as what kind of equipment you can request to help you get your work done, or any additional awesome little perks that might make your day to day work that much better.  &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Another list is  who to contact with any specific questions about any topic, then a bit of information about company culture, and perhaps most conveniently, a Who’s Who list of fellow employees. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;This includes a little blurb from each person as well as their name and a picture. I’m sure we’ve all been led through an office our first day and been introduced to 50 new faces all at once. Now new hires can discreetly go back and put Becky or Bradley’s name to their face. &#x000A;&#x000A;Finally, We also make sure to collect feedback from new hires about the onboarding process and how the board helped them or could be improved. We use this information to reprioritize cards by dragging and dropping them to change their position, or make changes that will improve the onboarding process for future hires.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;- Employee Manual&#x000A;&#x000A;Creating an employee manual on a Trello board is a simple, visual, easy to update, easy to search and accessible anywhere resource. This is valuable for not only new hires, but for anyone that works at your company, because it is a repository of all important company policies, forms and documents. Lists can be broken down into whatever makes sense for your company  such as benefits, policies, and perks, and cards can be easily rearranged to draw attention to more important topics. Let me go over how we have ours set up.&#x000A;&#x000A;We have a list with a single card on it for every employee’s first day. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;This card links to all of the most important cards on the board so that they are not missed, as well as any other important information that we want to reinforce on day one that may have already been covered on onboarding board, but we want to make sure gets covered.  A quick note, as you can see we link directly to other Trello cards here. It is easy to link to another Trello card by simply copying and pasting the link to that card in another card’s description. You can also use a hashtag and start typing a card’s name to search for and link to a card.&#x000A;&#x000A;Our Employee Manual has a list for all of the company’s benefits, and each topic has it’s own card. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;On each card we use the description to link to any related websites, and can attach any forms such as health insurance forms to the card as well. &#x000A;&#x000A;The next list covers everything one might have to ask about vacation policy, sick leave, etc. This actually came in handy for me recently when I was on jury duty and had to fill out some forms. One of the questions was about getting paid by your company during jury duty and I was able to access this board from my phone and quickly get the necessary information. Much better than having some printout filed away in the depths of my filing cabinet. &#x000A;&#x000A;The next lists cover items like conference budgets and travel guidelines, since everyone at the company is allowed to attend relevant conferences, and there is often the need to travel for work related matters.&#x000A;&#x000A;Since our company is half located in our NY headquarters and half remote, we have separate lists explaining the various perks that both headquarters and remote employees can enjoy, and answer common questions about either.&#x000A;&#x000A;Finally we have a catch-all list for any important topics that need to be addressed.&#x000A;&#x000A;- Social Committee &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;The last board I want to share is a newer board for us, but something that we are really excited about because we truly believe in building an awesome company culture at Trello. It is the Social Committee board, which allows the team to organize fun events for both remote and headquarter employees. Anyone is allowed to create an event, so this board starts out with a list explaining what the goals of the board are and the process for creating a team event. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Creating an “About” list or “How To Use This Board” list is a great way to give an overview of a board’s workflow and intent for any first time viewers, and always makes a handy reference for anyone that needs a refresher on a policy or process.&#x000A;&#x000A;The next lists are pretty self explanatory, such as what’s being planned, what’s coming up and what fun has been had. If someone is planning an event they should add themselves to that card and add any related boards, Slack channels, or details about the event. &#x000A;&#x000A;If someone wants to join an event, they can add themselves to the card so that the event organizer has a headcount of who is attending. A couple quick tips, first, make sure that your board is team visible so that anyone on your team can join the board and then add themselves to cards&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Also, you can share invite links to boards and drop them into an email or chat room to spread the word throughout the company.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Finally, we love sharing the fun we’ve had as a team and we encourage everyone to attach pictures to cards, either by clicking the attachment button and selecting the file from your computer or cloud storage solution, or by simply dragging and dropping a file right onto a card. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Our HR team likes to share these pictures on our Trello Instagram account because it works as a great platform for potential applicants and candidates to learn more about our company culture. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;So that wraps up my presentation of how Trello can help make HR easier for your team.  I am going to get the Q&amp;amp;A session going in just a moment, focussing on questions about these boards first. Please enter any questions you have in the GoToWebinar box and I will make sure to address as many as possible in the time remaining.  If you have to leave the webinar now and have questions or if you would rather ask your questions in private, feel free to email us at support@trello.com and we will be glad to answer them for you.&#x000A;&#x000A;[HR Made Easy With Trello Handout PDF](http://bit.ly/25Jlx1D)&#x000A;Learn more about [Trello Business Class](https://trello.com/business-class)</textarea>
